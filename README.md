## Overview

#### This project is a clone of the classic Flappy Bird game, built using Unity and C#. It demonstrates proficiency in game development concepts, physics-based gameplay, UI design, and object pooling. The project is structured to be efficient, scalable, and easy to understand for developers.

# Features

-2D Physics-based Gameplay: Utilizes Unity's physics engine for realistic movement and collision detection.

-Infinite Scrolling Background: Implements an endless background scrolling system for an immersive experience.

-Obstacle Spawning System: Dynamic object pooling to efficiently manage obstacles and enhance performance.

-Score System: Keeps track of the player's score and displays it using Unity UI.

-Game State Management: Includes start, game-over states for a complete gameplay loop.

-Simple UI/UX: Clean and responsive UI elements for score display, restart functionality, and menus.

-Difficulty Scaling: Gradually increases difficulty over time to challenge the player.

-Animation System: Uses Unityâ€™s Animator for smooth transitions and visual effects.

# Technologies Used

-Unity (Game Engine) - Version 2021.x or later

-C# (Programming Language)

-Unity Physics Engine

-Unity UI System

-Object Pooling for Performance Optimization

-Unity Animator for Animations

# Controls

-Spacebar - Makes the bird flap and ascend.

# How It Works

-The bird moves forward automatically.

-The player must tap or press to make the bird flap and navigate through obstacles.

-Colliding with an obstacle or the ground ends the game.

-The score increases each time the bird successfully passes through a gap.

-The game gradually increases in difficulty as the player progresses.

-The player can restart the game after a game-over screen.

# Future Enhancements

-Implement a leaderboard system using Firebase or PlayFab.

-Add power-ups to enhance the gameplay experience.

-Introduce new character skins and themes.

-Integrate social media sharing options.

-Expand to multiplayer mode with online competition.

-Implement cloud saving and data persistence.

-Add achievements and reward systems.
